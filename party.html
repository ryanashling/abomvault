        <div class="card bio">
            <p class="bg">The youngest son of an elven family, and brother of Zan, he is haunted by the
                death of his oldest brother, for which he feels responsible. He left home at a young age
                unable to handle being around the memories or his family, whom he felt were
                always judging him and wishing HE had been the one who drowned that day. Diving
                into alcohol as a way to avoid his past, he naturally took up the way of the
                alchemist. He resides at The Crow's Cask and helps Mataloy concoct all sorts of crazy
                beverages.

            <h2 class="name"> Zanathel Aelweard</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="card bio">
            <p class="bg">The middle child of the Aelweard family and Tala's older brother. The death
                of his older brother caused him to withdraw inward, becoming easily irritable and
                prefering life as a loner. He spent the better part of a decade attempting to
                find magic powerful enough to bring Xer back. Believing he had finally found a way,
                he left Otari for the better part of a year but returned unsuccessful and even more
                bitter at life. His sense of loyalty to his brother led to him walking the path of
                the cleric.

        <div class="card bio">
            <p class="bg">This easily overlooked gnome grew up in Otari after his family
                seemingly abandoned him on a visit to the town from the Underdark. Adopted by Wrin,
                he fell in love with reading any tome, scroll, or diagram on which he could lay
                his hands. He fancies himself a font of knowledge and uses this to aid people he
                considers worthy. Due to his size and ability to recall even the weirdest facts about
                various denizens of the world, he found himself under the gaze of Yinyasmera, head
                of the local "Thieves Guild".

                interactions in the past with Oloria Gallentine during her adventuring
            days. He can be seen around town, usually near the fishery with his
            feline companion, Moe-Dal.

        </div>
        <div class="card bio">
            <p class="bg">Kayden has lived in Otari all of his life. His parents left
                the Realm of the Mammoth Lords while his mother was pregnant with him,
                giving birth during their boat travels south. The vessel was attacked
                and sunk by pirates, causing the death of most of the crew, including Kayden's 
                mother. His father was able to save both Kayden and himself and they were discovered
                by Otari fishermen. As way of thanks, Kayden's father settled in Otari and joined the
                town guard. Kayden found himself walking the path of a Redeemer of Sarenrae.
